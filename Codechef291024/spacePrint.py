'''Print Python Programming
To print "Python" and "Programming" on the same line with a space in between, you would write:'''
'''Select one of the following options:
print("PythonProgramming")
print("Python  ","Programming")
print("Python","Programming")
print("Python")
print("Programming")
Excellent work!

Correct Answer:

print("Python","Programming")
Explanation:
"," is used to separate multiple outputs on the same line inside the print statement

Please note that 2nd and 3rd option are not same. Second option already has trailing space in the first string. So it will print two spaces between the strings.'''
#correct Option
#print("Python","Programming")
